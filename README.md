# Follow the instructions below to run the app locally
### If you have an android emulator already installed on your local machine or perhaps android 11+ actual phone, then run the following commands

```
1. git clone git@github.com:chriford/plantation.git
```
```
2. cd plantation
```
```
3. npm install --force
```
```
4. npx react-native start
```
```
5. npx react-native run-android
```
 ### If all went well for you during the installation, well, I assume you have the appliaction running by now. 
 ### And don't forget to rate me.
